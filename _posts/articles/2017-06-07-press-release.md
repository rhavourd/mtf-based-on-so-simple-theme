**Non-profit *Michigan Takes Flight* Dedicated to Advancement of General 
Aviation in Flint, MI Area**

_Flying Club at Flint Bishop Airport creates 501(c)(3) for flight 
education, instruction and training_

**Flint, MI:** Today, the Greater Flint Pilots Association announced 
creation of a 501(c)(3) non-profit named Michigan Takes 
Flight to promote advancement of affordable flying education and instruction opportunities in the greater Flint, MI area. 

Michigan Takes Flight (MTF) will promote the expansion of interest in and understanding of private flying and aviation 
providing grants and gifts for scholarships, education and instruction and other charitable purposes relating to general 
aviation in the State of Michigan. Anyone with an interest in supporting the future of general aviation is invited to 
donate. 

Initially, tax deductible charitable donations will fund flight instruction scholarships for qualifying students. Like any 
charitable endeavor, the Michigan Takes Flight scholarship fund will be dependent upon the generosity of its benefactors 
for support. Donations are expected from aviation-related businesses, local school systems, colleges & universities, 
aviation enthusiasts and the general public. MTF invites donors to consider endowing a named scholarship to honor someone 
special within their life, or to include a bequest to the MTF scholarship fund as part of their estate planning. Donors 
should contact info@gfpa.org

Over time, Michigan Takes Flight will grow and advance general aviation in the six-county area surrounding Flint through 
gifting of flight instruction scholarships and by providing other charitable education, instruction, and training to 
further general aviation.

**About Michigan Takes Flight:** The nine-member board of directors of 
Michigan Takes Flight are also the directors of the 
Greater Flint Pilots Association (GFPA), a premier not-for-profit general aviation recreational flying club based at 
Flint Bishop International Airport since 1975.
