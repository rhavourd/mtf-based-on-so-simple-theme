# Minimum Costs to Budget for Learning to Fly

Assuming a regular private pilot's license (i.e. not sport/recreation), a part 61 instructor, and a rented aircraft, then you need to budget for the following:

-   Aircraft rental (this usually includes oil and fuel)
-   Instructor time (air and ground)
-   Materials (books, DVDs, charts, fuel tester etc.) as recommended by your instructor
-   Headset
-   Third-class medical
-   Insurance
-   Written test fee
-   Examiner's fee for the actual test

If we assume the aircraft costs $100/hr wet (i.e. including oil and fuel), an instructor costs $40/hr and you need 50 hours to be ready for the test (40 is the minimum required) then you can do a calculation like this:

-   35 flying hours with instructor: $4900
-   15 flying hours solo: $1500
-   15 hours ground school (instructor's time): $600
-   Materials: $500
-   Headset: $500
-   Third-class medical: $100
-   Renter's insurance: $250 (per year)
-   Written test fee: $150
-   DPE test fee: $400 (plus $100 rental for the aircraft)
-   Total: $9,000 *

_This is only an example and may be on the low side. The total cost is subject to many variables including student aptitude. Some say the national average is 60 to 70 hours which could make the total $12,000 or more._
